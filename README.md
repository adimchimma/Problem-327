# Problem-327
 
A two-person game is played as follows. A rectangular box with dimensions 5 x 13 x 31 is filled with 5 * 13 * 31 = 2015 unit cubes, 
where each unit cube has a unique (x,y,z) address in the box. Alice selects a cube (a,b,c) and removes it; she also removes all the 
cubes in the three lines through this cube parallel to the edges of the box. For instance, if Alice chooses (1,2,3), then all cubes 
with addresses (x,2,3), (1,y,3), and (1,2,z) will be removed. 
(The remaining cubes stay in place—there is no gravity in this problem.)
Then Bob does the same thing; he chooses a unit cube from what remains, and he removes it and everything else along the three lines determined by his cube.
The players alternate turns, each time choosing a cube as above.
Assume each player takes as many cubes as possible each turn. There is no winner; the players hug at the end. Grabbing Cubes asks three questions.
1) How long will this game last?
2) How many cubes will each player end up with?
3) Note that 2,015 is the product of three distinct odd primes. Will I still be editing this column the next year this happens?
